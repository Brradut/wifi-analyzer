The project contains a mix of technologies. All packet parsing and general low-level logic is implemented in pure C, using minimal libraries (libpcap). The resulting C functions are then called directly from GO (thanks to `cgo`, which allows C bindings). The only reason I'm using GO and not just C is to have an easier time creating the GUI by using Wails, which allows me to create a Vue app that gets turned into a desktop app. 


To actually have a reproducible build that is intended to work on multiple systems without massive headaches regarding the toolchain, Docker was used. All the necessary components were added to the image, and the files we actually care about were then exported from this image (this includes shared libraries like libpcap).
